# Eighties - Vim Color Scheme

A port of the [base16-eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim)
theme using [Colortemplate](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate)
with some slight personal modifications.

Major differences:

- Thinner vertical split bar.
- Black on yellow instead of red on yellow for the wild menu.
- Italic comments (configurable).
- Italic strings (configurable).
- Dark mode only (for now at least).
- Better support for 256 colors<sup>1</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> Requires your shell to be configured with base16-eighties colors,
e.g. https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-iterm2.

See https://vimcolors.com/976/eighties/dark to for a generated example of what
it looks like.
